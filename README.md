# Scaled
A weight-tracking app to get fit and stay fit!

I've always been curious about app development, and what better way to learn about it than to jump right in?
I developed Scaled as a way to learn more about this aspect of computer science, while two of my major passions - technology and wellness.
Scaled lets users log their weight day by day with the ability to view their real-time progress.
It is an ongoing project of mine as I continue to learn more about the possibilities in app development.
I look forward to diving into more passion projects as I continue my journey in computer science.

Scaled as taught me a lot about the world of app development, and I find myself eager to keep going further with this project.
Through my own self-motivation, I have learned technical concepts such as:
  - The basics of app development, such as creating working buttons and getting user input using the user interface.
  - The concept of classes, inheritance, and interfaces and how they can work together to implement different features.
  - Development using Android SDK, including using different layouts and learning how different types of files interact.
  - Resources such as GraphView and SharedPreferences which were useful for the data involved in an app like Scaled
  
Additionally, I found myself strengthening skills as a computer scientist as well:
  - Learned how to ask questions to efficiently achieve the desired result.
  - That going in with a plan and taking notes along the way is crucial to keep the process organized.
  - Self-motivation to learn more about what I am curious about in a hands-on way.
